README
===================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

EXAMPLES

The distribution contains a sample driver application and test data in
the examples directory.  To look at the markup for the test data,
search for the (((BEGIN))) tag.

DIRECT MODE

To run

./learn.wrapper < sample1.html

In order to move the contents of a hypertext link out of the tag, use
--expand-hrefs.  For an example of how to do this look at sample2.html

./learn.wrapper < sample2.html

SAVING A GRAMMAR


To save off a grammar

./learn.wrapper --extract-grammar < ./sample1.html > /tmp/saved.grammar

You can then use this grammar to do future parsing

./learn.wrapper --load-grammar /tmp/saved.grammar < ./sample1.html
